## Design Direction

- **Color palette**: Evolve from the current blue/white to a warmer, more calming palette — think soft navy, warm whites, touches of sage green or gold accents
- **Typography**: Clean, modern serif for headings (elegant, trustworthy) paired with a readable sans-serif for body text
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace throughout — let the content breathe, reflecting the meditative brand
- **Photography**: High-quality, warm-toned imagery of real sessions and community
- **Animations**: Subtle fade-ins and scroll-triggered reveals for a calm, polished feel
